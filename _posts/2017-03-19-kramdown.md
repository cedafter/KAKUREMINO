# Kramdown preview
This is a preview of some most used **Kramdown** formatting elements.
It is used to preview and compare CSS styles on generated HTML elements.

## Paragraph
A block of text is wrapped in a paragraph (\<p\>).
A new paragraph is generated for every block of text preceded by a blank line.
\\
Two consecutive backslash or space characters generated a line break (\<br\>).

HTML element(s): **\<p\>**

## Text formatting
A text can be formatted like examples below but cannot be **underlined** :
* **Bold** (\<strong\>)
* *Italic* (\<em\>)
* ***Bold and Italic*** (\<strong\>\<em\>)
* ~~Strike through~~ (\<del\>)

HTML element(s): **\<strong\> \<em\> \<del\>**

## Headers (heading) {#headers-id}
Headers have an auto-generated ID by default but a custom ID can be specified too.
\\
Note: auto-generated ID has been *disabled* for this preview.

# H1 Heading (\<h1\>)
## H2 Heading (\<h2\>)
### H3 Heading (\<h3\>)
#### H4 Heading (\<h4\>)
##### H5 Heading (\<h5\>)
###### H6 Heading (\<h6\>)

HTML element(s): **\<h1\> \<h2\> \<h3\> \<h4\> \<h5\> \<h6\>**

## Blockquote
Kramdown formatting is supported inside a blockquote (\<blockquote\>).
Its content is wrapped in always paragraph (\<p\>).

> Keep things simple and ~~stupid~~ quick.

HTML element(s): **(\<blockquote\>) (\<p\>)**

## Code (Preformatted text)
A code generates a \<div\> with a class value of <<highlighter-rouge>>.
\\
The \<div\> contains a \<pre\> with a class value of <<highlight>>.
\\
The \<pre\> element contains a \<code\> element which contains the text content of the code.
\\
When a programming language is specified then the text content becomes a sequence of \<span\>.

~~~
/* Example of preformatted text aka *Code* */
if(Math.max(work.duration, fun.duration) > settings.threshold) {
  if(listeners.isEmpty())
    addListener(this.supervisor);
  schedule(Alerts.WARNING, Messages.THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED);
}
~~~

HTML element(s): **\<div\> \<pre\> \<code\> \<span\>**

## Unformatted text (No conversion)
Text can be generated **AS-IS** without any conversion (longer wrapped in paragraph).

{::nomarkdown}
This "text IS NOT wrapped in a paragraph".
It is generated **AS-IS** without any conversion.
{:/}

HTML element(s): **none**

{: height="36px" width="36px"}

HTML element(s): **\<img\>**

## Links
Link examples:

* URL links:
  * [Github](https://github.com/ "Github website")
  * Styled link (color): [Twitter][Twitter URL]
  * Using angle brackets syntax: <email@example.com>
* Links to ID in the same document:
  * [Headers](#headers-id)
  * [Conclusion](#conclusion-id)
* Link to a Kramdown file in the same directory:
  * [blog.md (This will target **blog.html** not blog.md)](blog.md)
  * [blog.html (Generated by Jekyll from blog.md)](blog.html)

[Twitter URL]: https://twitter.com "Twitter website"
{: style="color: #181"}

HTML element(s): **\<a\>**

## Footnotes
A footnote[^1] term definition is always generated **at the end of the document**.
The generated footnote ID for this example is *<<fnref:1>>*.
\\
The footnote link (\<a\>) is wrapped in a \<sup\> element.
The link targets the definition ID which is *<<fn:1>>* for this example.

HTML element(s): **\<sup\> \<a\>**

[^1]: A footnote definition is always generated at end of the document.
    \\
    Each definition is a list item (\<li\>) in an unordered list which
    contains all other footnote definitions.
    \\
    A **four** spaces indentation is required at the beginning
    of each line of a multi-line footnote definition.
    \\
    The definition content is wrapped in a paragraph (\<p\>)
    and it has a link (\<a\>) back to the footnote ID which is *<<fnref:1>>*.
    \\
    HTML element(s): **\<ol\> \<li\> \<p\> \<a\>**

## Lists

**Ordered list (\<ol\>)**
1. Ordered list (Like this list).
  1. Item.
  2. Item.
2. Unordered list.
2. Definition list.

**Unordered list (\<ul\>)**
* Ordered list.
* Unordered list (Like this list).
  * Item.
  * Item.
* Definition list.

**Definition list (\<dl\>)**

Term (\<dt\>)
: A term is an element of the list (\<dl\>). The list is not called a **"term list"** though.
: A term definition like above (\<dd\>).

Another term (which makes the previous text become a term)

: A definition preceded by a blank line is wrapped in a paragraph (like this one).

: Same for this one which is wrapped in a paragraph (\<p\>).

HTML element(s): **\<dl\> \<dt\> \<dd\> \<p\>**

## Table
Table **does not support multi-line** text.

| Header 1: TR1 / TH1 | Header 1: TR1 / TH2 | Header 1: TR1 / TH3 | Header 1: TR1 / TH4 |
|:-|:-:|:-:|-:|
| Body 1: TR1 / TD1 | Body 1: TR1 / TD2 | Body 1: TR1 / TD3 | Body 1: TR1 / TD4 |
| Body 1: TR2 / TD1 | Body 1: TR2 / TD2 | Body 1: TR2 / TD3 | Body 1: TR2 / TD4 |
|---
| Body 2: TR1 / TD1 | Body 2: TR1 / TD2 | Body 2: TR1 / TD3 | Body 2: TR1 / TD4 |
| Body 2: TR2 / TD1 | Body 2: TR2 / TD2 | Body 2: TR2 / TD3 | Body 2: TR2 / TD4 |
|===
| Footer 1: TR1 / TH1 | Footer 1: TR1 / TH2 | Footer 1: TR1 / TH3 | Footer 1: TR1 / TH4 |

HTML element(s): **\<table\> \<thead\> \<tr\> \<th\> \<td\> \<tfooter\>**

## Miscellaneous

### Typographic symbols
Example of available symbols :
* em-dash: ---
* en-dash: --
* Guillemets: << guillemets\\
symbols >>

### Underline text
Alternative solutions to underline text can be one listed below :
\\
Specifying an *inline style attribute or CSS rule*{: style="text-decoration: underline"}.
\\
Wrapping in an HTML <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #00F;">
"span" element with inline style attribute or CSS rule</span>.
\\
Using the HTML <u>"underline" element</u>.

### Kramdown comment
Kramdown syntax supports comments ie ignore a sequence of Kramdown text.
\\
{::comment}
Putting line break sequence in a new line like above is easier to read !!!
{:/}
Below is a syntax example for commenting Kramdown text :
~~~
{::comment}
Anything here and here will be ignored (Excepted when preformatted like this).
Any closing tag like {:/comment} or {:/sometag} can be replace by {:/} which is an equivalent.
{:/comment}
~~~

### Horizontal line
Three consecutive dash each separated by a space character
will generate an horizontal line (\<hr\>).
\\
The sequence must be preceded by a blank line (Otherwise it is interpreted as a heading).

HTML element(s): **\<hr\>**

_ _ _

### Abbreviations
Abbreviation (\<abbr\>) can be defined for any word.
It is case sensitive and will apply to all occurrences of the word.
\\
For example an abbreviation has been defined in the end of this document for "word".

HTML element(s): **\<abbr\>**

## Conclusion
{: id="conclusion-id"}

**Kramdown** has enough formatting features for writing simple documents like blog articles.
\\
The syntax is not difficult and it has some limitations though but it is a nice tool !

*[word]: Example of abbreviation definition.
