# Version 0.1pre
This version was previously published as a *Beta* release but actually that was *wrong*.
Indeed, it was just a development work which hasn't been really tested.

According to **Wikipedia** this version should have been
published as a **"Pre-alpha"**[^1] release instead. Too bad...
\\
The published **v0.1b** release was then deleted and replaced by this **v0.1pre** release.
